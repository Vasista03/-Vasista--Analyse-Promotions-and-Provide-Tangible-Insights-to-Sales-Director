    "FreshMart is a leading retail chain with more than 60 supermarkets across the southern states of India. During the festive seasons of Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024, all FreshMart outlets launched large-scale promotional campaigns on their in-house branded products. Now, the Sales Director is keen to evaluate the performance of these promotions — to identify which campaigns were successful and which fell short — in order to plan more effective promotional strategies for the next festive season.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Sales Director, Mr. Kunal Deshpande, wanted the results urgently, the analytics manager, Rohit Menon, was already occupied with another priority project. To ensure the task was completed on time, Rohit delegated the responsibility to Aditi Sharma, a data analyst at FreshMart known for her curiosity and problem-solving skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the analysis outcomes will directly guide strategic sales decisions, Rohit also shared some initial guidance and notes with Aditi to support her work in preparing actionable insights for the Sales Director."
